Task tracker   
Please develop a small SPA with this simple requirements:   
* Present visually a list of tasks in 3 different states: Planned, In progress, Completed.   
* Each task contains, name, description, estimate and state.   
* The user needs to be able to add/remove and change the state of the tasks.  
* Somewhere in the SPA you need to present an up to date status, adding up all hours for each state.  
Notes:   
You can assume it's a single user SPA, and there's no need to store data; but the user needs to be able to add/remove and see tasks.
